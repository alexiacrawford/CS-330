# CS-330
C/C++ and Unix
The primary objective of this course is to become familiar with practical software design and programming activities in a C/C++ and Unix environment. The course does not assume any previous experience with C/C++, but does assume programming experience in other languages. Familiarity with data structures and object oriented programming is assumed. In addition to learning many aspects of the C and C++ languages, we will focus on good programming practices and tools that support them, such as revision control and shell scripting. We will also cover topics in systems, parallel programming, and simple linear algebra. Throughout the course, we will focus on issues of good programming style and practices. The assignments and project will be done in a Unix environment and we will learn about various Unix tools along the way.
